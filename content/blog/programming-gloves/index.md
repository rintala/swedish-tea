## <a name="intro">Keep Hands Warm, Type Fast, and Stay Stylish</a>

So, at the moment our startup has office space at an incubator in Stockholm. The building is a so called 'smart-house' which means the heating is dynamically adjusted and takes into account that people will generate heat. However, the problem with COVID - the offices are literally empty, which results in freezing temperatures and numbing cold fingers. The CTO of our neighbouring team wears a coat, hat and scarf, while programming. For myself, the Patagonia sweater is absolute heaven and keeps the body warm, but my fingers and hands are suffering. I have been looking out for solutions to this problem, but there are no real good gloves for programming, either they are too thick in the finger material to type, or they are not really adding any isolation. This Christmas I recieved one of the best gifts ever - my girlfriend's mom had heard the rumour that I was looking for gloves, and hand knitted these awesome custom made gloves that are both warm, comfortable and fit my favorite Patagonia sweater in colour! Couldn't be happier - no more freezing hands in the raging Swedish winters! And the fingers are free to move over the keyboard in ultra-speed.

Thought I would share this, maybe someone is looking to solve this very same problem of cold hands when programming. Make sure you get your exercise and circulationg flowing, but also maybe ask a grandma, mom or relative to knit you a custom pair of super gloves.

Stay coding!
